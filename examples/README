# EXAMPLES

Examples from the book [Orange'S:一个操作系统的实现](https://book.douban.com/subject/3735649/) is put under this directory. It's a great book to get started from if you want to build your own system from scratch.

## Environment

Since the book is a little bit old, some of the software it used is outdated. My development environment is a little bit different from the book.
